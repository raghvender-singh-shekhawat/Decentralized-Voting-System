Project Title: Decentralized Voting System
Description:
The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based application designed to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof online voting processes. Built using smart contracts and a decentralized front-end, this system eliminates the risks associated with centralized authorities by distributing control across a blockchain network.

Key Features:
Blockchain-Backed Security: Utilizes Ethereum (or Polkadot) smart contracts to securely record votes, ensuring immutability and transparency.

DAO-Inspired Governance: Designed with a decentralized governance model where each vote is tied to a verified wallet address, enabling fair and trustless decision-making.

Front-End Interface: Developed using modern web technologies like React or Vue.js for a seamless user experience.

Wallet Integration: Voters connect their Web3 wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to authenticate and cast votes.

Vote Anonymity: Preserves voter anonymity while maintaining vote integrity.

Real-Time Results: Displays live results through direct interaction with the blockchain.

Gas Optimization: Smart contracts are optimized to minimize gas fees during deployment and voting interactions.

Tech Stack:
Smart Contracts: Solidity (for Ethereum) or ink! (for Polkadot)

Front-End: React.js or Vue.js

Blockchain Interaction: Ethers.js or Web3.js

Wallets: MetaMask or Polkadot.js

Development Tools: Hardhat/Truffle (for testing and deployment)
